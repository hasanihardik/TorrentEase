# Bit-Torrent Client (Peer to Peer protocol)

This is a BitTorrentClient using NodeJS, Typescript and this has a basic download endpoint which when provided a torrent file start downloading the data from the peers following the Standard Bit Torrent Protocol. It's a vary basic project and thus have a lot of limitation. Currently I am not thinking of improving it but If I get some time I might come back to it. The Current limitations that I know of are it is limited to udp protocol... and has issues with torrent sometimes ... have easier javascript version up which is better than this...
